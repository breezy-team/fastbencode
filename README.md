fastbencode
===========

fastbencode is an implementation of the bencode serialization format originally
used by BitTorrent.

The package includes both a pure-Python version and an optional C extension
based on Cython.  Both provide the same functionality, but the C extension
provides significantly better performance.

Example:

```
>>> from fastbencode import bencode, bdecode
>>> bencode([1, 2, b'a', {b'd': 3}])
b'li1ei2e1:ad1:di3eee'
>>> bdecode(bencode([1, 2, b'a', {b'd': 3}]))
[1, 2, b'a', {b'd': 3}]
```
